\
\
**Why is your group suitable for the project?**\
Arjun and I are both interested in learning more about SLAM, and have basic knowledge of it already.\
\
**Motivation, design goals, deliverables, system blocks, hw/sw requirements,**\
**team members responsibilities, project timeline, references**\
\
Motivation: Wanting to learn more about SLAM\
Design Goal: Understanding the role of dataset characterization in domain adaptive tracking\
Deliverables: \
• Implement and understand the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm , and\
its dataset Characterization Framework (code provided)\
• Label dataset with characterization and test the quality of dataset (data provided)\
• Analyze characterization metric, design and implement at least one more metric that is not part\
of given framework\
Team Members: Samuel Almeida, Arjun Viswanathan\
Responsibilities: \
      Lead Software: Arjun Viswanathan\
      Lead Research: Samuel Almeida\
Project Timelines: TBD, Split final due date into threee sections for the deliverables\
