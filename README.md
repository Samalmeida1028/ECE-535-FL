# ECE 535 Course Project: Multimodal Federated Learning (FL) on Internet of Things (IoT) Data

# Team Members: 
Samuel Almeida \
Arjun Viswanathan

# Why is your group suitable for the project?
We would like to learn more about how multimodal data is learned and a model is built from that, as well as its applications to IoT. We both have a solid understanding of ML models, and would like to see how we can use that knowledge in this project. 

# Motivation
Wanting to learn more about FL

# Design Goal: 
Understand and benchmark different multimodal datasets in a federated setting

# Deliverables: 
• Understand multimodal FL 
• Use given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper
• Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy
• Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution

# Responsibilities:
Setup: Arjun Viswanathan \
Software: Both \
Networking: Samuel Almeida \
Writing: Arjun Viswanathan \
Research: Samuel Almeida \
Algorithm Design: Both 

When we say both of us are assigned a responsibility, we will take equal parts to complete that responsibility. 

# System Blocks


# HW/SW Requirements
A computer that has Python, and optionally CUDA-enabled capabilities, and a GPU

# Project Timeline: 
The due date is TBD, but we are hoping we will work 1-4 hours on this project per week to advance towards the finish line and create our final presentation and demos
