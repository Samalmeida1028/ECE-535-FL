# ECE 535 Course Project: DataSet Characterization for Tracking Algorithms (Domain Adaptive SLAM)

# Team Members: 
Samuel Almeida \
Arjun Viswanathan

# Why is your group suitable for the project?
We are both interested in learning more about SLAM, and have basic knowledge of it already from taking CS 383: Artificial Intelligence last semester. We are also very versed in programming and AI algorithms. 

# Motivation
Wanting to learn more about SLAM. 

# Design Goal: 
Understanding the role of dataset characterization in domain adaptive tracking. 

# Deliverables: 
• Implement and understand the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm , and its dataset Characterization Framework (code provided) \
• Label dataset with characterization and test the quality of dataset (data provided) \
• Analyze characterization metric, design and implement at least one more metric that is not part of given framework

# Responsibilities:
Setup: Samuel Almeida \
Software: Arjun Viswanathan \
Networking: Both \
Writing: Arjun Viswanathan \
Research: Samuel Almeida \
Algorithm Design: Both 

When we say both of us are assigned a responsibility, we will take equal parts to complete that responsibility. 

# System Blocks
TBD

# HW/SW Requirements
A computer that is capable of doing image processing, and also running Python/C++ code 

# Project Timeline: 
The due date is TBD, but we are hoping we will work 1-4 hours on this project per week to advance towards the finish line and create our final presentation and demos
